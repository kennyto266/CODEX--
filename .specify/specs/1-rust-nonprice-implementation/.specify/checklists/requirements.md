# Specification Quality Checklist: Rust Non-Price Data Technical Indicators System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-10
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](.specify/specs/1-rust-nonprice-implementation/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Note**: 3 clarification markers identified but within acceptable limit (max 3)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All mandatory sections completed with detailed user stories
- 4 user stories defined with P1/P2 priorities
- 10 functional requirements specified with acceptance scenarios
- 8 success criteria with measurable metrics
- Edge cases and risks documented
- 3 clarifications marked for user feedback

**Clarifications Required:**
1. Real-time vs batch processing preference
2. Output format preference (executable/library/API)
3. Integration approach (standalone or with Python ecosystem)

**Status**: READY FOR /speckit.clarify
