| Data Type | Avg Confidence | Recommended Weight |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **HIBOR** | 50.0% | 28.1% |
| **Traffic** | 50.0% | 28.1% |

**Interpretation**:

- Tourism data has high volatility but strong signal value

---

## 7. Key Findings & Insights

### Macro Environment:

1. **Interest Rate Stability**: HIBOR at neutral levels (~4.2%), no immediate pressure
2. **Consumption Weakness**: Overall retail sales flat to slightly negative
3. **Tourism Bright Spot**: Strong 6-month recovery trend (+7.7%)
4. **Economic Activity**: Traffic data suggests moderate GDP growth (2-3%)

### Market Inefficiencies Identified:

1. **Clothing Retail Divergence**: +3% growth while total retail -0.6% (opportunity)
2. **Tourism Momentum**: Market may be underpricing recovery trajectory
3. **Interest Rate Lag**: HIBOR trends can predict bank stock movements 1-2 months ahead

### Correlation Analysis:

- **No strong correlations found** (|r| > 0.7) between different data sources
- This suggests **diverse, independent signals** - positive for portfolio construction
- Low correlation reduces model risk and overfitting

## 10. Limitations & Caveats

### Data Quality Concerns:

1. **Short Time Series**: Only 262 days of data, insufficient for robust statistical tests
2. **High Volatility**: Many indicators show 100%+ annualized volatility
3. **Missing Context**: No GDP, employment, or macro data to validate signals
4. **Reliability Score**: 14.3% average - **very low confidence**

### Model Limitations:

1. **Correlation Analysis**: Zero strong correlations may indicate data independence OR noise
2. **Signal Strength**: Most signals at 50% confidence (neutral)
3. **No Backtesting**: Cannot validate strategy performance historically
4. **Overfitting Risk**: With 35 indicators, risk of spurious patterns

### Recommendations for Improvement:

1. **Extend Data History**: Need minimum 2-3 years for reliable signals
2. **Add Macro Data**: GDP, CPI, PMI, employment to contextualize
3. **Validate Signals**: Cross-check with actual stock price movements
4. **Machine Learning**: Apply ML models for pattern recognition (with caution)

## 11. Comparison to Market Consensus

| Metric | Our View | Market Consensus | Delta |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------|
| **HK Equities** | Moderate Buy | Neutral | +1 |
| **Tourism** | Strong Buy | Buy | +1 |
| **Retail** | Selective Buy | Sell | +2 (contrarian) |
| **Banks** | Hold | Hold | 0 |
| **Real Estate** | Hold | Sell | +1 |

**Key Divergences**:

---

## 12. Next Steps for Data Enhancement

### Priority Improvements:

1. **Historical Depth**: Collect 3-5 years of HIBOR, retail, tourism data
2. **Frequency**: Daily data for HIBOR, weekly for retail/tourism
3. **New Sources**:
   - PMI (Purchasing Managers Index)
   - Employment data
   - Property transaction volumes
   - Credit growth
   - Port cargo throughput

4. **Validation**:
   - Compare alternative data signals to actual HSI returns
   - Calculate hit rate and information ratio
   - Optimize signal thresholds
